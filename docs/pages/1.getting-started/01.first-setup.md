The easiest way to experience Tweek, is to setup a playground environment.  
There are two ways to do it:
- Create online playground environment - using PWT website
- Create local playground environment - using docker-compose

#### Online - Play With Tweek (experimental)
- Go to https://play-with-tweek.com/
- Follow the UI instructions to create new environment

#### Local - Run Locally using docker-compose
- clone Tweek's repo (```git clone https://github.com/Soluto/tweek.git```)
- go to deployments/dev (```cd tweek/deployments/dev```)
- (optional) pull the images instead of building (```docker-compose pull --parallel```)
- run (```docker-compose up```) - this might take a few minutes the first time
