#### Running Tweek
- clone the repo (``` git clone https://github.com/Soluto/tweek.git ```)
- go to deployments/dev (``` cd tweek/deployments/dev ```)
- (optional) pull the images instead of building (```docker-compose pull --parallel```)
- run (``` docker-compose up ```) 

#### Edit your first key
- Open http://editor.dev.local.tweek.fm:81 in browser.
- Go to keys page.
- Click on "Add New Key"

#### Gradual Feature Release
Create new key in the editor "my_app/sign_button/is_enabled" with value type "boolean" and default value False.  
Add new rule, remove all conditions, set the the rule value to gradual release with 50%.
Try querying configuration with different users and You'll have different results.
